# personal-explorations

i am not sure how this all works and the instructions that i am following recommended naming this file "hello World' since that
is the first name used in learning programming such as JAVA/

For now this readme is just to briefly state that my intentions are to use udacity.com to learn JAVA and my long term goal is to learn 
Android development. I have been watching Youtube videos off and on for the last several months maybe even a year has passed since I began
this new interest.

I plan to ask Gypsy to participate with learning Github so that she and I will have version controls and the flow of ideas that we both 
have put into the constraints of this type of program.

So many ideas and possible things to do with our time prioritizing amd just trying to use this program to visualize timelines 
is what I hope to accomplish.

Personal explorations for me is to find out what I need to focus on. Now how I learn to use this Github with my general writing and 
as a platform for my ideas to be clarified.
